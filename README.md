Cell Society
============

Cell Society is a cellular automata simulator which has the ability to model several different simulations. The types of simulations are found below:

> Schelling's Model of Segregation: [Segregation](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/)
> Wa-Tor World: [Wa-Tor](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2011/scott-wator-world/)
> Conway's Game of Life: [Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
> Slime Mold Behavior: [Slime](http://zool33.uni-graz.at/schmickl/Self-organization/Group_behavior/Slime_mold_behavior/slime_mold_behavior.html)

How to Run Simulations
----------------------
Each simulation is provided with default load information. However, it is very easy to set new parameters. You may use the sliders and toolbars to customize or switch simulations. Below the main window, you may set custom parameters for the current simulation: simply type in the new parameters, press submit, and then reset. Then run the simulation and see what your parameters did!

Advanced features include the ability to change the state of a cell by directly clicking on it. You also have the ability to change the default loading configurations of the simulations by modifying their XML files, found in the xml folder.
